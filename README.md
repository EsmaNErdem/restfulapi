In this exercise, We created our very first Restful APIs. In the app.py, we created our api urls in the back and also we opened a front route to showcase our work.  We made our model database table instance model on model.py and some instances by running seed file. 
As we render our index.html,  we are also getting a form instance from our Form model in form.py. This way, we were able to exercise WTForms as well as SQLAlchemy, Flask, Python, Object Oriented programming and the last but not the least Front-end JS. With vanilla JS in the front, we showcased our Restful API by calling API to get an item list to list them all in our index file and submitting a form posting a new instance in our db and deleting selected instances.
